# VRChat Avatar Crasher
This is a simple tool to change your avatar into another Avatar ID and refuse it to load ingame.

### Important
This will disallow any new worlds / avatars being downloaded, so you will need to make sure the worlds you join are already cached and that the avatar you want to load for everyone else is not cached on your side. This tool only prevents write, not read.

Read the instructions in the actual software on how to utilize it.. or just read the source. Up to you.

This is for eductional purposes only. I have nothing to do with this incase it is utilized for malicious usage.
